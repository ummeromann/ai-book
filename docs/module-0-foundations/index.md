## Module Overview

Welcome to the foundational module of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. Before diving into the technical tools and frameworks, you need to understand what Physical AI means, how it differs from traditional software-based AI, and why humanoid robots represent a unique challenge and opportunity in this field.

**Key Technologies Covered**: Conceptual frameworks, humanoid platforms, sensor systems

## Learning Path

This module establishes the conceptual foundation you'll need throughout the book. You'll learn:

1. What Physical AI and embodied intelligence mean
2. How digital AI differs from robots that understand physical laws
3. The current landscape of humanoid robotics and their sensor systems

## Chapters in This Module

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence](./ch01-intro-physical-ai)

Your journey begins with understanding what Physical AI is and why embodied intelligence matters. You'll explore the history, applications, and the embodiment hypothesis that drives this field.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Define Physical AI and explain the embodiment hypothesis
- Identify real-world applications of Physical AI
- Understand why physical interaction changes how AI systems learn

---

### [Chapter 2: From Digital AI to Robots that Understand Physical Laws](./ch02-digital-to-physical)

Explore the fundamental differences between digital AI systems and robots that must interact with the physical world. Learn about physics-informed machine learning and world models.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Compare digital AI with embodied AI systems
- Explain physics-informed machine learning concepts
- Understand the simulation-to-reality challenge

---

### [Chapter 3: Humanoid Robotics Landscape & Sensor Systems](./ch03-humanoid-landscape)

Survey the current humanoid robotics landscape, from Boston Dynamics Atlas to Tesla Optimus. Understand the sensor systems that give humanoids their perception capabilities.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Identify major humanoid robot platforms and their capabilities
- Explain different sensor types (vision, IMU, force/torque, LiDAR)
- Understand sensor placement and function on humanoid bodies

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Curiosity about robotics and AI
- No prior robotics experience required

## What You'll Build

By the end of this module, you will have:

1. A solid conceptual foundation for Physical AI
2. Understanding of the humanoid robotics landscape
3. Knowledge of sensor systems used in humanoid robots
4. Vocabulary and concepts needed for technical modules
